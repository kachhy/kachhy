### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate Computer Science student and aspiring software engineer with a strong foundation in **Python** and **C/C++**, eager to build impactful applications and explore new technologies.

### Proficient in
**Python:** Flask, FastAPI, Discord.py
**C++**
**C#**

### Experience in
**JavaScript & TypeScript:** React, React Native, Mantine
**Proxmox**
**Docker & Docker Compose** 


### Here are some of my projects
**General purpose Discord bot:** A Discord bot with features for server utilities, moderation, and games.
**A containerized homework testing program:** A Python program that manages Docker containers to run both efficiency and effectiveness tests on programs with an expected output.
**A C based chess engine:** Developing an efficient and small chess engine using modern search and evaluation techniques.
**Humanlike chess website (built with [Python/Flask] and [React/TypeScript]):** a website that replicates popular chess websites like Chess.com and Lichess, with the exception that every player is an AI profile based on MaiaChess. It benefits players that enjoy the challenge of playing chess versus players of their level without having another person to play with. 
**Beat Saber map parser:** A robust Python library to parse, represent, and enable conversion between complex Beat Saber map data across various schema versions.
**Beat Saber map difficulty rater:** A Python program built on my map parser to objectively analyze and quantify the difficulty of a map with an objective, multifaceted scale.
